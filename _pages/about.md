I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of British Columbia supervised by Professor Vered Shwartz and Professor Raymond Ng.
Before coming to UBC, I worked as a software engineer at Enovix Corporation. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science 
and Mathematics at UC Berkeley.
